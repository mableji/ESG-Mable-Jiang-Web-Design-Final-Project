          <h2>What is Governance in ESG?</h2>
          <article>
            <p>The Governance pillar of ESG focuses on how a company is directed and controlled. Originating from the Latin word “gubernare,” meaning to steer, governance is about guiding corporate behavior through leadership, structure, and oversight. As companies have grown in scale and complexity, strong governance ensures that business operations are conducted responsibly, transparently, and in alignment with stakeholder interests. This includes practices like board independence, executive compensation, audit oversight, shareholder rights, and risk management. Effective governance helps foster accountability, ethical conduct, and long-term value creation.</p>

            <p>Good governance balances accountability and alignment. It ensures that decision-making processes are transparent, that leadership acts responsibly, and that corporate culture supports sustainable value creation. Investors evaluate governance through factors such as board independence, executive compensation, audit quality, shareholder rights, and the integrity of disclosure practices. Effective governance not only safeguards against corruption and mismanagement but also strengthens a company’s ability to address environmental and social challenges, reinforcing its long-term performance and resilience.</p>

          <h2>Three Board Committees</h2>
          <p>Good corporate governance often centers around three key board committees, each addressing a critical area of accountability and oversight:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Nominations Committee
              <ul><li>Ensures a balanced and effective board by overseeing director selection and succession planning. In some regions, this is called the Corporate Governance Committee.</li></ul>
            </li>

            <li>Audit Committee
              <ul><li>Oversees financial reporting, external and internal audits, and risk management. This committee ensures transparency and accountability in the company’s financial operations.</li></ul>
            </li>                  

            <li>Remuneration Committee
              <ul><li>Aligns executive compensation with company performance and shareholder interests. Also referred to as the Compensation Committee in some markets.</li></ul>
            </li>
