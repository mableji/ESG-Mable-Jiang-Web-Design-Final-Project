My website for the final project focuses on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance), a framework that evaluates how organizations operate beyond financial performance alone. I've been on ESG for a while, and my interest was further strengthened when I earned the Certificate in ESG Investing from the CFA Institute in November 2024. Through that experience, I came to view ESG as not only an ethical concern but a strategic imperative that directly affects financial performance, risk management, corporate reputation, and long-term business sustainability. ESG influences companies, investors, and society as a whole. Even at the individual level, environmental responsibility matters, as the planet we live on ultimately depends on collective awareness and action.

My website serves as an introductory platform for audiences who are interested in understanding ESG and its real-world relevance. My homepage talks about ESG concepts from a macro perspective and guides audiences toward the three pillars through a clear and intuitive navigation structure. Each pillar page introduces key ideas using concise headings, readable paragraphs, and supporting visual elements. 

My site was designed to use responsive layout techniques to ensure the contents are accessible on both mobile and laptop devices. Interactive JavaScript elements are used to enhance user engagement and to ensure the site is fun, including a daily sustainability message and a switch to an eye-care theme for improved readability during extended reading.

Overall, I built this site to help audiences grasp a better understanding of what ESG means, why it matters in modern decision-making, and how it can be applied through practical actions, responsible governance standards, and long-term sustainability thinking.
